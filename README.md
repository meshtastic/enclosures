This section is for all information and files regarding Hardware Enclosures for Meshtastic devices. This is a file hub to help designers and Meshtastic users alike, with files and docuemtnation regarding enclosure for users, and technical CAD references of compatible boards to assist designers develop more enclosures! The files are organized into their respective categories by compatible hardware boards. To learn more about what board options are compatible with Meshtastic check out the hardware page: https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware

# NOTE FOR USERS:

Happy Printing!


# NOTE FOR HARDWARE DEVELOPERS:
If you are planning to contribute CAD models and documentation for enclosure designs and reference models of components alike (Antennas, hardware, etc.) please read the following information. If the design uses elements from other designers, don't forget to credit them in the READ.ME

Thank you for your contribution!

# Instructions for uploading

Upload respective files following the repo organization structure (may change in future updates)

    - Compatible Boards (TTGO T-Beam, Rak, ect.)
       - Specific Board Models (Example T-Beam m8n or m6)
          - Respective enclosures files and readmes

After finding the respective board your enclosure is compatible with, create a folder in the board model folder with the title as your enclosure name. Post the related files in that folder. We encourage you to add a read me with more details regarding the enclosure (Instructions and additional resources would be a big plus!) along with a picture at the top so it can be seen easily. Ensure to fill out the Universal Spec Sheet following the template below and add it to the bottom of the readme. This allows for quick and easy specs for different users to determine which enclosure suits their need quickly.
